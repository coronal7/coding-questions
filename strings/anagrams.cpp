// Check if two strings are anagram of each other.
// If one string can be rearranged to form another string, then they are anagrams of each other.
// LISTEN and SILENT. 

// Length of both strings should be same and character count also.
// First approach is to sort both the strings and then compare characterwise. This will take O(nlogn) time.
// Second approach is to use hashing. It will take O(n ) time and O(alphabet size(26)).

// Stroring a single hash and decrementing in it is an efficient approach.
